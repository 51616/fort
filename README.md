# fort
My utility repo for personal work (multi-agent reinforcement learning). It is inspired by (and based heavily on) [rebar](https://github.com/andyljones/megastep/tree/master/rebar) and his [Andy jones' util repo](https://github.com/andyljones/aljpy). "fort" comes from fortress/fortify which is a synonym for reinforce. It is meant to help my reinforcement learning projects. Some of the utils are fairly generic though.
